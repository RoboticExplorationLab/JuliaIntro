    "## Getting Packages\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using the Package Manager\n",
    "To use the package manager from the REPL (recommended) press the `]` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Locations\n",
    "If you installed Julia with default settings, it should place all files beneath your home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/username/.julia`\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of important sub-directories:\n",
    "* `dev` - contains git repositories of the packages being developed. It is okay to edit files in this directory\n",
    "* `packages` - contains git repositories of the packages downloaded via the package manager. You should not edit these files.\n",
    "* `compiled` - contains compiled files (`*.ji`) for pre-compiled packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a registered package\n",
    "To add a registered package use the `add` command within the Package Manager. This will install the package on your computer and add it to your active project. For example, to add the ForwardDiff package simple enter\n",
    "\n",
    "`(v1.0) pkg> add ForwardDiff`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Package\n",
    "Once installed, a package is brought into the the workspace using the `using` command:\n"

    "5. Create the main project file within your source folder using your favorite editor. This needs to have the same name as the Package, e.g. `src\\NewPackage.jl`. To do this from Juno, select File|Open Folder and open the repository. Open a new file (CTRL-N) and save it to the `src` folder. The file needs to have the following contents:\n"
