    "## Getting Packages\n",

    "If you installed Julia with default settings, it should place all files beneath your home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/username/.julia`\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of important sub-directories:\n",
    "* `dev` - contains git repositories of the packages being developed. It is okay to edit files in this directory\n",
    "* `packages` - contains git repositories of the packages downloaded via the package manager. You should not edit these files.\n",
    "* `compiled` - contains compiled files (`*.ji`) for pre-compiled packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a registered package\n",
    "To add a registered package use the `add` command within the Package Manager. This will install the package on your computer and add it to your active project. For example, to add the ForwardDiff package simple enter\n",

    "`(v1.0) pkg> add ForwardDiff`\n",

    "You may have already noticed that we requested you to reboot the REPL after each time you changed your package. This is necessary due to the way Julia handles packages within the global scope of the REPL. There are two ways of getting around this development headache:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Revise.jl\n",
    "2. Juno IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revise.jl\n",
    "Revise.jl is made specifically to get around this issue of having the reload the workspace when changes are made to a package/module. Basically you run it prior to loading in any other modules and it takes of most of the headache. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Juno IDE (recommended)\n",
    "Juno has some clever ways to get around this issue, and has some other nice features that make your life as a developer easier. Here we will go over basic workflow to minimize how many times you need to restart the REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a \"working\" script that acts basically like your REPL. You easily turn these scripts into test scripts later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the \"working module\" of the script by clicking \"Main\" in the status bar and enter the name of your package, or use the shortcut (CTRL+J CTRL+M). The status bar should change to display the name of you module once you do this. Note that this is file-dependent. You should notice that Juno does this automatically for files that are included in your main file. You can even do this for the REPL to access the variables in the workspace of your module.\n",

    "![change_module](../img/ChangeModule.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With the active module set to your package, any variables, functions, types, etc. that you create in your scipt will be created in the workspace of the your package, and has direct access to all variables and functions of your package (i.e. you don't need to use NewPackage.newfun, even if you haven't exported it). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you add or change a function in one of the files included in your project, you can reload it by hitting CTRL-RETURN (moves to next statement or function) or SHIFT-RETURN (doesn't move cursor). You can now re-run that function in your \"working\" script and will see the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. DISCLAIMER: This will save you a lot of time, but it often a good idea to restart your REPL if you begin to observe odd behavior. It's not uncommon to have a variable, function, or method that you don't realize is there that affects behavior. When in doubt: restart the REPL. NOTE: You will ALWAYS needs to restart the REPL after making changes to custom types. \n",
